# log-php
A simple PHP module for logging.

This provides some commonly-used logging functionality, like being able to relay LoggerInterface functionality between objects.

This is not and is not intended to be anything like a full-featured logging framework like (the excellent) Monolog. It mostly gets used to provide a default logging option for other libraries, and for catching and checking log messages during testing.

## Installation

You can require it directly with Composer:

```bash
composer require jdwx/log
```

Or download the source from GitHub: https://github.com/jdwx/log-php.git

## Requirements

This module requires PHP 8.2 or later.

## Usage

To use this module, you can instantiate one of the logger objects directly:

```php
$logger = new \JDWX\Log\StderrLogger();
$logger->info( 'Hello, world!' );
```

Or you can use the RelayLoggerTrait to provide a LoggerInterface on your object while only having to implement a single method:

```php
class MyClass implements \Psr\Log\LoggerInterface {
    use \JDWX\Log\RelayLoggerTrait;

    public function log( int $level, Stringable|string $message, 
                         array $context = [] ) : void {
        echo "Log message: {$message}\n";
    }

}

$x = new MyClass();
$x->info( 'Hello, world!' );
```

There are many unit tests for this module which provide additional examples of usage.

## Stability

This module is considered stable and is used in production code. The test coverage is complete except for testing StderrLogger.

## History

This module was refactored from [jdwx/app](https://github.com/jdwx/app) in January 2025 to better support web-based applications.
